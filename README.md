## HazardRateTest
An R package for a statistical test that compares the hazard rates of two samples.

**Note**: due to the complexity of calculating the test statistic, it is not recommended to use this test for large sample sizes in this package's current version. It has only been tested up to samples sizes of *n=m=100*, which took a few minutes to run, and the run time increases exponentially with the sample sizes.

## To Install
Installation requires the `devtools` package.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("wbbreslin/HazardRateTest")
```

## Using this Package
The main function in this package is the `hazard_test` function. This function is analogous to the `t.test` or `wilcox.test` functions in base R. All of these functions output the test statistic and p-value for their respective tests. Consider the two data sets generated by the R code below.
```{r}
set.seed(314)
x = rexp(n=10, rate=1)
y = rexp(n=10, rate=1/2)
```
The `hazard_test` function can be applied to these two data sets.
```{r}
hazard_test(x,y)
```
This will output:
```{r}
$W
[1] -0.3940741

$Z
[1] -1.505205

$p.value
[1] 0.1322714
```
