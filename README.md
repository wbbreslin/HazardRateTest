## HazardRateTest
An R package for a statistical test that compares the hazard rates of two samples. 

For a full description of the package and the statistical test, refer to the corresponding thesis pdf file:

## To Install
Installation requires the `devtools` package.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("wbbreslin/HazardRateTest")
```

## Using this Package
The main function in this package is the `hazard.test` function. This function is analogous to the `t.test` or `wilcox.test` functions in base R. All of these functions output the test statistic and p-value for their respective tests. Consider the two data sets generated by the R code below.
```{r}
set.seed(314)
x = rexp(n=10, rate=1)
y = rexp(n=10, rate=1/2)
```
The `hazard.test` function can be applied to these two data sets.
```{r}
hazard.test(x,y)
```
This will output:
```{r}
$Phi
[1] -798

$W
[1] -0.3940741

$Z
[1] -1.505205

$p.value
[1] 0.1322714
```

Interpreting the output:
* Phi is the kernel of the test statistic, which is the total number of x-pair & y-pair sequences suggesting X greater than Y in hazard rate ordering, minus those suggesting X less than Y in hazard rate ordering
* W is our test statistic, which is Phi rescaled such that it is between -1 and 1
* Z standardizes W to have mean=0 and sd=1, which is used for the normal approximation of the p-value
* The p-value is exact for sample sizes n and m less than or equal to 10, otherwise the normal approximation is used

The other function in this package is `null.dist`, which is used to find the exact null distribution of the test statistic given two sample sizes. Using two samples with 3 data points each as an example:
```{r}
null.dist(m=3,n=3)
```
This will ouput the null distribution in a frequency table.
```
              W Occurrences Probability
[1,] -1.0000000           2        0.10
[2,] -0.5555556           3        0.15
[3,] -0.3333333           2        0.10
[4,] -0.1111111           3        0.15
[5,]  0.1111111           3        0.15
[6,]  0.3333333           2        0.10
[7,]  0.5555556           3        0.15
[8,]  1.0000000           2        0.10
```
The exact null distribution is not needed for sample sizes m>8 and n>8, as the normal approximation is sufficient beyond that point. It is not recommended to use this function for larger sample sizes due to the computation time required for it to run.
